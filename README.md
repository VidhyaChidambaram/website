# website
An attempt started in 2020 to set up website for showcasing portfolio. Or atleast become better
at javascript. 

Do i plan to host this? Um, no - not after i have put the code in a public repo.
But, i hope this contains enough code snippets, to use as an interview icebreaker.

## Directory notes

### httpd
* contains notes on apache webserver on docker

## Web server notes

* 2 main concepts :
 - Web hosting - provides storage for your web pages
 - Domain name - name of the website, unique in the context of internet
 
AWS in short is a hosting service, where we will configure our own web server or VM, or servers or 
use the managed services provided by AWS.
